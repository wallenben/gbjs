Gameboy emulator in typescript -- deprecated in favor of a Gameboy emulator written in C (to be posted)

This was one of the first iterations of my Gameboy emulator. There is some logic here for writing an opcode decoder along with emulating certain system properties in Javascript and Typescript.

My holistic emulator (non-toy) is written and C, and will be posted...eventually. Current flashcart logic is implemented, with opcode decoding/CPU up next.
